Installation
============

To run, you need [Isabelle 2013](http://isabelle.in.tum.de/) and [Nominal2](http://www.inf.kcl.ac.uk/staff/urbanc/Publications/Nominal2-2013.tgz).

Unzip the Nominal2 distribution anywhere, then clone this repo into the root directory where you unzipped.

    cd ~/path/to/Nominal2-Isabelle2013
    git clone https://github.com/akissinger/quanto-tensor.git

The theory files should then run when you open them in Isabelle. Be aware that when you first open any of the files, it takes quite a while to check because Nominal2 needs to build, but after that they should be pretty zippy.
